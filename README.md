This project trains machine-learning models to predict superconductivity from material descriptors and serves the predictions through a simple Flask API and HTML interface. The repository contains the training script (train.py), the server (app.py), the web page (index.html), required dependencies, and the dataset (materials.csv). After installing the requirements, running python train.py generates the models and supporting files, and launching python app.py starts the local server at http://localhost:8000/ for making predictions.
